shortens a url
also,
keeps track the views in url

routes...

post/url- generates a new short url and returns the shortened url

get/:id- redirects to the original user

get/url/analytics/:id- returns the clicks on the provided url

****for this we have to install a package called 'nano id'which
is used to generate nano ids which will help us to shortened the url****
